A fully responsive portfolio website to display my projects. Used react-router-dom for single page application. Used framer-motion for page transition and react-state to filter out tech stack projects. Used props to pass down data from parent to child components. Also implemented emailjs to receive email from user directly to my inbox.

Tech Stack: React, Sass, framer-motion, react-icons
